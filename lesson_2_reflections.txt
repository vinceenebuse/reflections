What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	Makes git aware that the folder could contain files to be tracked. If you do not initialize the repository, git 
	has no way of knowing that the folder needs to be tracked.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
	The staging area has changes yet to be committed while the working directory has the up to date version of all
	files including those not being tracked for changes. The rep however holds just the history of files that are 
	tracked.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
	By viewing the content of the staging area with git status before every commit.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
	When trying out experimental features or whole new structure of the code base. Branches help by ensuring that
	your original code stays intact.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
	They make it clear to understand and apply the concept of git branching.
