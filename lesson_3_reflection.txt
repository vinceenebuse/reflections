When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  a. If I want to share my work with other people. 
  b. If want other users to contribute to my work.
  c. For keeping a backup of my work incase I loose my local copy.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git 
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
  a. Incase I have made changes on my local copy that I do not want to lose or push yet.
  b. Incase I do not want the new updates on my local copy.
