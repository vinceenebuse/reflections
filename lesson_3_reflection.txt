  a. If I want to share my work with other people. 
  b. If want other users to contribute to my work.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git 
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

  b. Incase I do not want the new updates on my local copy.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
  Forks are copies of other repositories on Github.
  Clones are local copies of other repositories which might be on Github or remote or even on the same machine.
  Branches are slighted modifies versions of a given repository.
  You use forks to make copies of a rep you want to be able to modify on Github while clones are used to make local copies
  of reps and branches are used to try out certain modifications on a rep that can easily be merged to the rep.
