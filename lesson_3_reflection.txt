Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
  Forks are copies of other repositories on Github.
  Clones are local copies of other repositories which might be on Github or remote or even on the same machine.
  Branches are slighted modifies versions of a given repository.
  You use forks to make copies of a rep you want to be able to modify on Github while clones are used to make local copies
  of reps and branches are used to try out certain modifications on a rep that can easily be merged to the rep.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
  It helps to keep track of diffs between your local copy and the last known remote copy.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
  By exchanging physical files and waiting for comments/input before proceeding with further updates. Using Git or 
  Github is definitely faster and easier.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits 
does each approach have?
  When I do not have right to update master directly and when there could be changes to master before I publish my changes.
  I can get others to review and comment on my changes before they are added to master.
